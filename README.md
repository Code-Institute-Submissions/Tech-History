# Tech-History
A website about the unknown story of the IT industry and more specificaly around the Silicon Valley!
Why the origin is rooted in the World War II effort in Europe.
Why the Silicon Valley became the hub of the Digital Innovation.

## Why this project
I have a passion for history and especially tech history.

I had a personal project but it wasn't maybe enough to demonstrate enough knownledge for the P1.
I choose to do a timeline on a subject were I am passionate about...
**Innovation** and the **Silicon Valley** and **Technology History**.

Because it's an historical website regarding the tech industry. I am choosing Monospace fonts to make it look like a terminal.... with Green or Amber color.
I will try to had a terminal effect in CSS with a cursor blinking like this one:

## Current limitation
Due to extensive work required to cover the history of the tech industry from 1929 (Transitor) to 2007, I am for now limiting the current coverage up to 1971.
I am plannig to add far more details but it's a long term  project.

I would like to cover the topics below:

* The Valley: before the Silicon Valley
* The Silicon: history of the transistor
* The hardware: the different hardware company started in the Silicon Valley and elsewhere in the USA
* The software: history of Operating System from CP/M, Unix .... etc
* The network: history of Internet aka ARPANET and it's forgotten root with the European equivalent CYCLADES
* The peoples: Key figures of technologies and investments
* The money: History of Venture Capital and the Startup ecosystem


## The future
I am planning to add the years after 1971 when time permit it.
I have already done an extensive research on the subject and need to put that on a nice website.
Some fun facts or forgotten story.
The key people 
A tribute to many peoples who pionneerd the IT industry and for some who are already dead like:
- Dennis Ritchie
- Gary Kildall
- Jean-Marie Hullot
- ...

## Targeted audiance

To better predict the future we must better understand the past. This website will be an overview of past technology who are still in use today.
e.g. Why do we use 80 collum for programing? Because at the beginning there was no screen. TTY or also known as Teletype (like a typewriter) was used to display the content and it was by default 80 for the paper.

### Persona

Eavan, she is 22. She is a Computer Science student in Trinity College and she would like to better understand why 50 years after we still use some stuff in programming.
e.g. CTRL-C or CTRL-Z

Sean, 50 years old. He is a retro computer entusiast and would like to better understand the Commodore 64 that he bought on E-bay a few weeks ago.
e.g. https://eater.net/6502

Inspiration for the timeline taken from tutorials from w3schools: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_timeline.asp
Found a list of media-query useable for a responsive site :-) 

This is a terminal effect that I found on stackoverflow a long time ago and can't find the original post:
```color: #f0fff8; /* almost white */
text-shadow: 0 0 3px #80ffc0, 0 0 10px #00ff66, 0 0 20px #00ff66, 0 0 30px #00ff66;
```

# Testing
I consider that the web can be bloated. Less is more. I like simple, fast and elegant things when possible.

Tested with:
* Chrome (MacOS 12.4 & Windows 10)
* Firefox (MacOS 12.4, Windows 10 & FreeBSD 13.1)
* Brave(MacOS 12.4)
* Elinks (FreeBSD 13.1)
* Safari (MacOS 12.4 & iOS 15.5)

It's cleaner, better, faster and will probably enable me to release this project when it will be mature enough.
