I had a personal project but it wasn't maybe enough to demonstrate enough knownledge for the P1.
I choose to do a timeline on a subject were I am passionate off...
Innovation and the Silicon Valley.

Because it's an historical website regarding the tech industry. I am choosing Monospace fonts to make it look like a terminal.... with Green or Amber color.
I will try to had a terminal effect in CSS with a cursor blinking like this one:
