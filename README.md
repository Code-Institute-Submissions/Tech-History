# Tech-History
A website about the unknown story of the IT industry and more specificaly around the Silicon Valley!
Why the origin is rooted in the World War II effort in Europe.
Why the Silicon Valley became the hub of the Digital Innovation.

## Why this project
I have a passion for history and especially tech history.

I had a personal project but it wasn't maybe enough to demonstrate enough knownledge for the P1.
I choose to do a timeline on a subject were I am passionate about...
**Innovation** and the **Silicon Valley** and **Technology History**.

Because it's an historical website regarding the tech industry. I am choosing Monospace fonts to make it look like a terminal.... with Green or Amber color.
I will try to had a terminal effect in CSS with a cursor blinking like this one:

## Current limitation
Due to extensive work required to cover the history of the tech industry from 1929 (Transitor) to 2007, I am for now limiting the current coverage up to 1971.
I am plannig to add far more details but it's a long term  project.

I would like to cover the topics below:

* The Valley: before the Silicon Valley
* The Silicon: history of the transistor
* The hardware: the different hardware company started in the Silicon Valley and elsewhere in the USA
* The software: history of Operating System from CP/M, Unix .... etc
* The network: history of Internet aka ARPANET and it's forgotten root with the European equivalent CYCLADES
* The peoples: Key figures of technologies and investments
* The money: History of Venture Capital and the Startup ecosystem


## The future
I am planning to add the years after 1971 when time permit it.
I have already done an extensive research on the subject and need to put that on a nice website.
Some fun facts or forgotten story.
The key people 
A tribute to many peoples who pionneerd the IT industry and for some who are already dead like:
- Dennis Ritchie
- Gary Kildall
- Jean-Marie Hullot
- ...
