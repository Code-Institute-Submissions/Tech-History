                <h3>Before 1939</h3>
                  <p>
                      Until 1939, the silicon valley was mostly empty. The main road, going south San-Francisco was at that time the junction between San-Francsico and Los-Angeles.
                      El Camino Real was mainly passing thru religious missions and farms.
                      It is difficult to believe but there was nothing special to put the Silicon Valley on the map.
                      Stanford University was absolutely unknown and there was no "real" engineering research done at Stanford at that time.
                  </p>
                <h3>The Secret Story</h3>
                  <p>
                      The first company in the Silicon Valley was Hewlett-Packard (1939). At that time HP was producing tools for labs. The computer was still unknown.
                      Like all good companies, HP started in a garage. The HP Garage is now a private museum.
